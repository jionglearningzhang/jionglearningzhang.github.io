With the trend of data science getting more and more popular,
it is quite often the question asked "what is data science".
While data science has a quite wide coverage, here I will try to give a brief overview of data science. 
Hopefully, this blog could be helpful to gain better understanding of this field.

## 1. The ultimate goals 

Data science is basically to utilize scientific methods to solve business problems through 
processing, analyzing and modeling data.
No matter what we do with the data, we should always keep the ultimate goals in mind: 
we either want to help the company to 
**make more money** (increase profits with increasing the revenue or decrease the cost) 
or to **make our customers happier** (improve customer experiences).
You may checkout the data science use cases to gain a better understanding [1].

Therefore, it is not enough to find only insights from data but find the insights, 
which are really actionable, the insights will help us reach the aforementioned two ultimate goals.


## 2. The general work-flow

1. **Data collection**. 
The first thing is to gather the data we will be working on. 
Data scientists usually work with data engineers, who build production data pipelines 
and get the data ready for data scientists. 
We also need to be aware of other data sources that can be used 
as complementary data to solve our problems. 
There are more and more open source dataset. 
There are also some cases, data scientists need to do some web scraping.

2. **Exploratory data analysis**.
This is a very important stage and data scientists usually spend most of the time at this stage.
Here we deep dive into dataset and get to know the data distribution, calculate different metrics, 
find out variables correlations. Statistics inference techniques can also be used at this stage 
to estimate different variables.

3. **Problem definition**
This is a important stage for connecting the business world and the mathematics world. We need to
abstract the business problem out as the problem that we can solve through leveraging 
the power of computation and machine learning. 


4. **Modeling**
Here is where we apply machine learning techniques to do some modeling,
 evaluate the trained models and build up the prediction pipeline.

5. **System integration**
Integrate the prediction pipeline into data pipeline. This part usually requires a lot of engineering efforts.

6. **Experiment (A/B testing)**
Run experiment for the model in production.

7. **Conclusion**
Conclude the project, summarize the insights, document the model and performance.



## 3. The focused stages

1. Analytics 
2. Machine learning
3. Deep learning

The deliverables will be in 3 formats: 1) reporting system 2) predictive model 3) data product.

## 4. The techniques and knowledge involved

1. CS fundamentals (python, algorithms and data structures, OOP)
2. Dataset manipulation (SQL, Pandas, Hadoop system, Spark)
3. Probability and statistics (helpful for analysis, hypothesis testing)
4. Traditional machine learning (Feature engineering & modeling)
5. Deep learning
6. Analytics (Marketing and product)
7. Communication (Visualization, presentation, writing) 
8. Problem solving skills


## 5. How do all these align with your academia experiences

While dedicate years of research on a scientific topic and made a Ph.D., 
you've probably acquired most of the knowledge and skills to be a successful data scientist. 
The key points of the knowledge system of a data scientist are listed in the previous part.
With your acedemic research projects, you surely have developed some methods to solve a well-defined problem,
 run some experiments, manipulated and analyzed data with some statistics and 
told some story from it (write a paper). This is also what data scientists do, 
but just in a business enviroment. To fill in the gap, you may want to build up some business sense 
and hone the skills of using certain tools and techniques which are popular in industry. 
In the following part, I will list out where you could learn this skills.
 

## 6. Nice study resources to check out

1. Edx: Introduction to Marketing.
This course is a great introduction of all the basic marketing concepts and some analytics methods, 
which I think a data scientist should always keep in mind.

2. Cousera: Machine Learning.
This is a classic course by one of the influencial machine learning researcher Andrew Ng, 
and a must for every data scientist to take.

3. sqlzoo.net:
A good walkthrough of using SQL for manipulating data.
