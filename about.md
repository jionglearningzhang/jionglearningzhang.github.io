I am Jiong Zhang (张炯), a data scientist in AI & digital vehicles, Mercedes-Benz Research & Development NA. I worked on theoretical and computational physics with Prof. Ioan Kosztin in Department of Physics and Astronamy, University of Missouri-Columbia (MIZZOU). I studied the problem of alloy solidification theory back in Tianjin University 天津大学(China) and moved to biological physics when I joined Dr. Kosztin's group. The main motivation and goal of my research in biological physics is to understand how living matter is organized and functions at different (e.g., atomic or microscopic, sub-cellular or mesoscopic) levels. My researches are related with Non-equilibrium statistical physics, Molecular Dynamics simulation, bioinformatics, protein structure prediction and data sciences. And currently focus on Potential of Mean Force (PMF) calculation and protein structure refinement and selection, Loop modeling in proteins. 

I feel so lucky that I'm doing what I'm doing. This is the best job in the world. I love physics, which allows us to understand the world and help us tear off the mask of nature staring at the face of god. 


要勇敢地去捍卫真正的科学，将其开拓为其添彩；既不为厚禄所驱，也不为虚名所赶，只求上帝真理的神辉普照大地，发扬光大
