I am Jiong Zhang (张炯), a Sr. Machine Learning Engineer in AI & digital vehicles, Mercedes-Benz Research & Development NA. I worked on theoretical and computational physics with Prof. Ioan Kosztin in Department of Physics and Astronamy, University of Missouri-Columbia (MIZZOU). I studied the problem of alloy solidification theory back in Tianjin University 天津大学(China) and moved to biological physics when I joined Dr. Kosztin's group. The main motivation and goal of my research in biological physics is to understand how living matter is organized and functions at different (e.g., atomic or microscopic, sub-cellular or mesoscopic) levels. My researches are related with Non-equilibrium statistical physics, Molecular Dynamics simulation, bioinformatics, protein structure prediction, data sciences and deep learning. And currently focus on utilizing deep learning for creating wonderful things.


I have the logo "INTELLIGENT LEARN" for my blog, it is also a side project (startup) I'm working to develop up.
