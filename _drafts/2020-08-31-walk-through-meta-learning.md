### A brief overview of meta-learning

* goal-conditioned reinforcement learning techniques that leverage the structure of the provided goal space to learn many tasks significantly faster
* meta-learning methods that aim to learn efficient learning algorithms that can learn new tasks quickly
* curriculum and lifelong learning, where the problem requires learning a sequence of tasks, leveraging their shared structure to enable knowledge transfer
